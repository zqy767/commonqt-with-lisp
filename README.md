# commonqt-with-lisp
a little app built with lisp using commonqt

When I search the whole github for an app using commonqt,I was suprised that I was so hard to find it.(maybe I search it in a wrong way:-) ) so i decide to put my own commonqt app to github for others to use. I was new to lisp,so the code may be somehow ugly.So I hope to get ideas from you to improve ourselves together.

The story began with a talk:-). my dream god asked me to make an app to help her learn Japanese.Of course I was so happy to help:-),As a lisper, I was glad to use commonqt to make it. Then goes my code.....
